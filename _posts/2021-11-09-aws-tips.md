This could be a little advice for beginners to the Cloud, these are a little experiences hosting content at AWS.

- In a lot of cases that you'll create a new EC2 instance, choose one of family T, because I'll attend you on the most of the cases, see here to more information about, [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)

- First, you need to create a new billing alert to send an email message when you're passing the Free Tier credits.

- If you are using a Free Tier credits, my advice is use Terraform(Hashicorp) to create and destroy your environment, is so simple of use and configuration(see [here](https://www.terraform.io/)). You can fill the form [here](https://pages.awscloud.com/adoptf90d_GLOBAL_POC-credits.html) to receive until 300 USD of AWS to create any projects that as a required. 

- Never execute the command ```aws configure``` in a EC2 Instance, the correct is create a new Role with read only on IAM resources add this role on the EC2 Instance;

- Never create a Security Group with all the inbound ports together, create a new Security Group only for SSH access and the rest to another things;  

- Think many times before create your first RDS(expensive) I spend a lot of credits using an RDS with a simple MySQL database and I prefer alert you, never enable Multi-AZ functionality, for God's sake.

- See this link before create your own nodes and establish a max number of pods on EC2 instances, using EKS, [https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/eni-max-pods.txt](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/eni-max-pods.txt)

- If you are using AWS CLI, install  AWS COMPLETION to expedite your life:
