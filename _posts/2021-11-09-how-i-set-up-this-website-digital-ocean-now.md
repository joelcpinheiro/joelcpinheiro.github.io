Dear all, unfortunately I had  to go out of hosting my portfolio on  AWS([https://joelpinheiro.com/what-i-use-to-build-my-website-aws/](__GHOST_URL__/what-i-use-to-build-my-website-aws/)) and I was thinking in a good cost benefit for me, so that provides me a single experience, then I choose a basic Droplet(1vCPU, 1GB Mem, 25GB Disk) on Digital Ocean to install the Ghost CMS and configuring my website.

I received 100 USD of credits to use on Digital Ocean in 60 days, a good gift because I have time to get how the DO's billing works and what  I'll pay before done those credits. Don't need to create an account, only use my Google Authentication to access the Digital Ocean Platform.

After access the platform, I choose one Droplet on the Marketplace called Ghost(Ubuntu 20.04), in details of Application have step by step to install and configure URL and SSL Let's Encrypt to your application, it was very  simple and intuitive.

After I had copied all the old files shared on GDrive and hosted on AWS to this new environment using gdown program installed via Python Pip.

And that's okay for now, and I don't know when, rs, I'll be here on Digital Ocean with my portfolio add a good content for all over the world.
